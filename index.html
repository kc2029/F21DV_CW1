    <p id="introduction">
      Covid-19(SARS-CoV-2) is a contagious airborne virus infection that has
      swept through the globe over the last two years with devastating effects
      on the world with hundreds of millions of cases of infections and
      millions of deaths and long-term health effects. This is a visualisation
      of how the world and countries deal with Covid 19, how different
      country's covid responds, the vaccination rate has on Covid-19
      performance against other countries

        This is a cluster analysis of the Total number of death vs the total
        vaccine per hundred people (including booster) also, a good indication
        of how wealthy the country is, to see if there is any relation between
        vaccine and death and also, continent. by hovering over a centroid,
        the chart will colour the points by the continent.<br /><br />
        we can see that poorer African countries have the lowest vaccine rate
        and death, this is most likely due to a lack of proper equipment and
        means to keep a record of covid, rather than any indication of their
        effectiveness of covid response, <br /><br />Asian countries, on the
        other hand, has much lower death per million compares to European
        countries with similar vaccination rates. This is likely due to Asian
        country has much stricter lockdown rules and its population are far
        more likely to follow the rules than European counterpart
